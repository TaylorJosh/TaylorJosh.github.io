        Lambeau Field, formerly called (1957–65) City Stadium, nickname Frozen Tundra, gridiron football stadium in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that is the home of the city’s NFL team, the Packers. It is the oldest stadium with an NFL team in continuous residence but has been much enlarged since opening in 1957.

        <br>
        Since 1960 every home game has been sold out. Seating capacity was increased over the years, rising past 50,000 in 1965. The stadium acquired its present name in the same year, shortly after the death of Curly Lambeau, cofounder of the Packers team in 1919. Unusually for an NFL stadium, Lambeau Field has not been renamed for a corporate sponsor, but naming rights were sold for each of its eight main gates.
        <br><br>
        As an outdoor stadium in a cold-weather city, Lambeau Field acquired the nickname “Frozen Tundra.” The stadium was the site of one of professional football’s most memorable games, the “Ice Bowl” of December 31, 1967, in which the Packers and the Dallas Cowboys played for the NFL championship in −13 °F (−25 °C) weather. The Packers won, 21–17. Nickname notwithstanding, the stadium turf is electrically heated to keep it from freezing solid in cold weather.

        <div id="food" class="reasons food"><b>Reason No. II:</b><br>Food</div><br>
        The stadium has some excellent food options at its restaurants and concession stands. Lambeau Field continues to update their food menu items each year, so be sure to visit again to see what is new! 
        <br> <br>
        Some of the Packers gameday concessions include a bratwurst piled high with mac and cheese. Plus, a “tailgater pierogi” that uses the unusual but delicious combination of cheese curds and Johnsonville bratwurst in tandem with its pillowy interior. The stadium offers these unique culinary creations as well as many other more traditional options.

        The 15,000-square-foot, two-level Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame is conveniently located on the main floor of the Lambeau Field Atrium. A tribute to the greatest story in sports, the facility uses technology, enhanced interactive displays and a treasure trove of artifacts to educate and inspire visitors about the rich history of the Packers, as well as the teams of today. 
        <br><br>
        The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame has encountered many expansions and renovations. In 2003, renovations to Lambeau Field provided a new home within the new Lambeau Field Atrium for the Hall. Packers legends Bart Starr and Ron Wolf rededicated the Hall on September 4, 2003. The Hall contains a vast array of Packers memorabilia, a re-creation of Vince Lombardi's office, plaques representing each of the inductees and the Lombardi trophies from Green Bay's four Super Bowl wins. As of 2019, the Packers Hall of Fame has inducted 162 people, 24 of whom have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the newest additions were to be inducted at the 50th Annual Induction Banquet, which was set to be held on Saturday, April 18, 2020. Unfortunately, the Green Bay Packer Hall of Fame, Inc. was unable to host that event. The latest inductees are Al Harris and Charles Woodson (2021).
